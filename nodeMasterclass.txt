Our Requirements
Before you start any of our courses, make sure you meet these requirements. In addition, each course may have specific prerequisites that you should meet before enrolling. If a course has any additional prerequisites, they'll be listed within the course descriptions (on this page above).
Full size laptop or desktop.

It is quite difficult to code professionally on a mobile device. Many of our courses require you to download and install IDEs and other pieces of software that likely will not work correctly on your phone or tablet.
Admin / root privileges on your workstation.

In order to access your terminal, install software and interact with the filesystem programmatically you'll need Root/Admin access on your computer. If you are the owner of the computer, your account is likely the Admin already. If you're using a shared workstation (such as in a computer lab), you'll need to ask the workstation administrator to give your account "admin" or "sudo" privileges.
A fast internet connection.

Our courses are not downloadable. Each lecture must be streamed. In addition, you'll want to stream in high-resolution so that you can read the small text on the screen without issue. For all these reasons it's very important that you have access to a fast and persistent internet connection.
Fluent in written and spoken English.

Our courses are taught in English only, and we do not provide translations or subtitles for our content. In addition, the resources we'll be directing you to use are generally available only in English. Lastly, the programming languages themselves are based on English words and syntax. If you're not comfortable with English you will struggle tremendously in any of our courses.
